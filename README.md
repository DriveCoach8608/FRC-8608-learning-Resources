# FRC# 8608 - Resources for Programming/cad/video


### Forenote to the parents in our area : you and your child are in a resource desert. we are trying to offer them something, anything STEM related. in our area of the usa the poverty rate is roughly 16%, this is worse than Macomb country (detroit) and the surrounding areas. source : https://www.povertyusa.org/data/2019/MI/ please be patient with your kids progress as they never had access to any of these tech related resources growing up, and be patient with mentors as they are all volunteers!

## Start Here - how to approach this whole new world: 
this is hyper-accelerated course that is hyper-focused on FRC.
Everything around FRC should be considered a highschool AP or entry level college class. nothing is easy. it should fill you with pride and accomplishment to even complete a few lessons or task. 
during the off-season teams meet 2 hours a week. from April to December we have 28 weeks. that makes 56 hours of robotics class TOTAL each year. 
YOU CANNOT LEARN ANY OF THESE SUBJECTS IF YOU ONLY WORK ON THEM DURING CLASS.
I repeat, if you come to class and attempt to remember what you were working on last week, you are already behind. The 2 hours we meet is best spent on questions and answers about what you were  learning over the rest of the week.  
the subjects you are attempting to learn are 4 year degrees at the COLLEGE level, such as Computer science, or mechanical engineering. Do not be discouraged, questions to the mentor show them who is most passionate about their results! and "dumb" questions are usually the smart students attempting to understand fundamentals about a subject. 

### How to use the resources here? 
programmers : goto the  programming repository https://github.com/jgarder/FRC-Command-Based-Lesson-Projects, clone it, create a branch with your name/nickname then and open FOLDER - lesson 0 in WPilib VSCODE (follow the quickstart guide) complete the task and report to the mentor about your git-branch, dont know any of these words? ask!!!

CAD/Designers :  we follow a YouTube channel called [Product Design Online](https://www.youtube.com/@ProductDesignOnline) course called 30 days of fusion here -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKb3mRkgTwg&list=PLrZ2zKOtC_-C4rWfapgngoe9o2-ng8ZBr

Cad/Designers on 8608 In person : you will also need an invite to the 8608 fusion 360 group to receive your education license, you will then need an invite to the TEAM to be able to see our project folders. here you will place a folder with your name and start putting all of your fusion projects!  then mentors will have access and be able to check your work and help!


video editors : we have marketing and other people, but for the people specifically doing video editing we use  DaVinci Resolve https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve at this time we have no mentors with any expertise in this field, but we have some rudimentary knowledge to help the students explore video creation and encourage the students to learn with us and even become the "lead mentor" until they graduate. 


### need a breather? 
we cant all study 24/7. if you feel overwhelmed and don't know what to do, but still have that robotics itch then i suggest watching some interesting robotics youtube videos. i suggest some of these to get ideas. -> process engineer, pid examples , mechanism explained videos.

 cad people can google "how to make X in fusion 360" where X =  screws/elevators/mechanisms in fusion 360 and watch an expert show you their workflow!

Video editors : you should google davinci resolve X where X = special effects that interest you, such as fade to black or slo-mo. ask the world your interest and see who has already struggled with the problem. see if they have some kinda answer you can use. be creative! video editing is not science.
